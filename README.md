# HyObscure

Minimizing privacy leakage and ensuring data utility is a critical problem to social media platforms (SMPs) for data publishing, namely privacy preserving data publishing problem. Due to data correlations, it is challenging to achieve an optimal privacy-utility tradeoff with hybrid obscuring on heterogeneous data. HyObscure is a novel hybrid protection mechanism focusing on heterogeneous data publishing on SMPs, which cross-iteratively optimizes the generalization and obfuscation operations to maximize privacy protection under a certain utility guarantee.
